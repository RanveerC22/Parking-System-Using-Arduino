# Parking-System-Using-Arduino

This project proposes the solution for the parking system problems with the help of Arduino and IR Sensors.

Process:

• The project consists of 4 IR sensor which represents 4 empty slots

• Used servo motor at the entry point, which opens only when at least 1 empty slot is available. When all slots are full, servo motor will not let any other car to enter into the parking zone and will wait for the slots to get empty (i.e wait untill previous cars exit).
